# Smartphone_based_Seizure_Detection
This android application was made as a part of Philly Codefest 2015 Competition.

The application acquires data of gyroscope and accelerometer of smartphone in real time. It further processes this data on the 
microsoft's azure cloud computing platform, where in several machine learning techniques are used to classify a specific action 
as a seizure or not a seizure. If the seizure is detected then the closed ones of the app-user will be notified immediately.
